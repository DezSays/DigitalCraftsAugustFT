#*Exercise 1: Calculate the multiplication and sum of two numbers. Given two integer numbers return their product only if the product is equal to or lower than 1000, else return their sum.*

# Part 1 Values:

# number1 = 20
# number2 = 30
# Expected Output: The result is 600

# Part 2 Values:
    
# number1 = 40
# number2 = 30
# Expected Output: The result is 70




#*Exercise 2: Print the sum of the current number and the previous number. Write a program to iterate the first 10 numbers and in each iteration, print the sum of the current and previous number.*

# Expected Output:

# Current Number 1 Previous Number  0  Sum:  1
# Current Number 2 Previous Number  1  Sum:  3
# Current Number 3 Previous Number  2  Sum:  5
# Current Number 4 Previous Number  3  Sum:  7
# Current Number 5 Previous Number  4  Sum:  9
# Current Number 6 Previous Number  5  Sum:  11
# Current Number 7 Previous Number  6  Sum:  13
# Current Number 8 Previous Number  7  Sum:  15
# Current Number 9 Previous Number  8  Sum:  17





#*Exercise 3: Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.*
