#*Exercise 1: Calculate the multiplication and sum of two numbers. Given two integer numbers return their product only if the product is equal to or lower than 1000, else return their sum.*

# Part 1 Values:

# number1 = 20
# number2 = 30
# Expected Output: The result is 600

# Part 2 Values:
    
# number1 = 40
# number2 = 30
# Expected Output: The result is 70




#*Exercise 2: Print the sum of the current number and the previous number. Write a program to iterate the first 10 numbers and in each iteration, print the sum of the current and previous number.*

# Expected Output:

# Current Number 1 Previous Number  0  Sum:  1
# Current Number 2 Previous Number  1  Sum:  3
# Current Number 3 Previous Number  2  Sum:  5
# Current Number 4 Previous Number  3  Sum:  7
# Current Number 5 Previous Number  4  Sum:  9
# Current Number 6 Previous Number  5  Sum:  11
# Current Number 7 Previous Number  6  Sum:  13
# Current Number 8 Previous Number  7  Sum:  15
# Current Number 9 Previous Number  8  Sum:  17





#*Exercise 3 PART 1: Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old. Concatenate strings to print the resulting output message. *

# Expected Output:

# Dezarea will be 100 years old in 2095.





#*Exercise 3 PART 2: Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old, except use f-strings instead of the + operator to print the resulting output message. *

# Expected Output:

# Dezarea will be 100 years old in 2095.






# *Exercise 4: Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an even or odd message to the user. *

# Expected Output (if even number):

# Even Number



# Expected Output (if odd number):

# Odd Number





# *Exercise 5: Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. For practice, write this code inside a function. *

# Expected Output

# [5, 25]





# *Exercise 6: Print characters from a string that are present at an even index number. Write a program to accept a string from the user and display characters that are present at an even index number. *


# Expected Output if the original string was dezarea:
# d
# z
# r
# a



# *Exercise 7: Write a program to remove characters from a string starting from zero up to x and return a new string. 

# For example:

# remove_chars("dezbryan", 4) so output must be ryan. Here we need to remove first four characters from a string.
# remove_chars("dezbryan", 2) so output must be zbryan. Here we need to remove first two characters from a string.
# Note: x must be less than the length of the string.
