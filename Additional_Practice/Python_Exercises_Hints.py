# *EXERCISE 1 HINT*
# Create a function that will take two numbers as parameters
# Next, Inside a function, multiply two numbers and save their product in a product variable
# Next, use the if condition to check if the product >1000. If yes, return the product
# Otherwise, use the else block to calculate the sum of two numbers and return it.


# *EXERCISE 2 HINT*
# Create a variable called previous_num and assign it to 0
# Iterate the first 10 numbers one by one using for loop and range() function
# Next, display the current number (i), previous number, and the addition of both numbers in each iteration of the loop. At last, change the value previous number to current number ( previous_num = i).
