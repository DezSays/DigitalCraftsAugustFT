// * HINT 1 *

// Set up a for loop
// assign a variable, set it to start at 0, and don't forget to increment it

// * HINT 2 *

// Set up a for loop
// assign a variable, set it to start at 1, and don't forget to increment it by 2

// * HINT 3 *

// assign a variable to 0
// set up a for loop with another variable starting at 1, going until it reaches 10, and incrementing by 1 each time it goes around
// reassign the first variable = first variable plus for loop variable

// * HINT 4 *

// assign a variable to 0
// set up a for loop with a second variable and assign it to 11, keep it going until our variable is <= 30, incrementing by 2 each time. 
// inside of our loop take the first variable we assigned to 0 and set it to equal the first variable plus the variable you are running through the for loop.

// * HINT 5 *

// set up an array of numbers
// set up a function to take in one parameter, which will be our array
// inside the function, assign a variable to 0
// set up a for loop, value starting at 0 and continuing to increment as long as the value is less than the length of the array
// inside the for loop, take the variable you assigned at the beginning of your function, and se it equal to the parameter you passed into your function, with the index position being the variable assigned in your for loop

// * HINT 6 *

// set up an array
// set up a function to take in one parameter
// at the beginning of your function assign a variable = 0
// write a for loop, starting at 0 and incrementing until it reaches the length of your array
// take the variable you assigned at the beginning of your function and set it = first variable of the function + array parameter with the index position being the variable assigned in your for loop.
// return your first variable / length of array
// assign one last variable that is equal to your function with your array passed in
// console.log your last variable

// * HINT 7 - Using a For Loop *

// assign a variable to a list of numbers
// set up our function to take in one parameter
// inside our function assign a variable to an empty list
// set up a for loop starting at 0 and incrementing until our for loop variable is equal to the length of our array
// inside the for loop assign a variable(we will call it x) your list with the index position being your for loop variable
// write an if statement to see if x is greater than 0
// take our variable that we assigned an empty list to and push x
// return our once empty list outside of the for loop
// assign one last variable that is equal to your function with your array passed in
// console.log your last variable

// * HINT 7 - Using Filter Method *

// assign a variable to a list of numbers
// set up our function to take in one parameter
// return using filter method

// * HINT 8 *

// assign a variable(x) to a list of numbers
// set up a function to take in one parameter (a list)
// assign a variable(y) to be equal to the parameter you passed in with the index position being at 0
// set up a for loop with a variable(z) starting at 0 and incrementing until it is equal to the length of the list
// set up an if statement so that if the list at position variable(z) is more than variable(y) then variable(y) is now = list in index position variable(x)
// after the for loop return variable(y)
// assign one last variable that is equal to your function with your array passed in
// console.log your last variable

// * HINT 9 *

// assign a variable to a list of numbers
// set up function to take in one parameter, a list
// set up a variable to an empty list 
// set up a for loop with the variable = the length of the array -1. The loop keeps running as long as the number does not drop below 0, decrementing each time it iterates.
// take the number in the list that is in the index position of the variable in the for loop, and push it to the variable you set up as an empty list. 
// return your once empty list 
// assign one last variable that is equal to your function with your array passed in
// console.log your last variable

// * HINT 10 *

// assign a variable to a string
// set up a function to take in one parameter
// within you function assign a variable to an empty string
// set up a for loop for a variable = the length of our string minus 1, as long as the word does not drop below zero it should decrement each time. 
// assign a variable = your string with the index position being that of your for loop variable.
// set your empty string value equal to empty string + the variable mentioned directly above
// return your once empty string
// assign one last variable that is equal to your function with your array passed in
// console.log your last variable


// * HINT 11 *

// set up two arrays to add
// set up a blank array to push new values to
// In your function, set up two for loops. The first for loop should run through the first array, and the second for loop should run through the second array. 



// * HINT 12 *

// Set up an array that needs to be sorted.
// Set up a function to take in one parameter. 
// Bubble sort checks the value of the current index and compares it to the value of the index beside it. Example: nums[i] > nums[i+1].
