# *EXERCISE 1 HINT*
# Create a function that will take two numbers as parameters
# Next, Inside a function, multiply two numbers and save their product in a product variable
# Next, use the if condition to check if the product >1000. If yes, return the product
# Otherwise, use the else block to calculate the sum of two numbers and return it.


# *EXERCISE 2 HINT*
# Create a variable called previous_num and assign it to 0
# Iterate the first 10 numbers one by one using for loop and range() function
# Next, display the current number (i), previous number, and the addition of both numbers in each iteration of the loop. At last, change the value previous number to current number ( previous_num = i).


# *EXERCISE 3 PART 1 HINT*

# Use the input function to get the users name, age they will be by the end of this year, and the current year.
# Subtract the users age from the current year and add 100 to it. Assign the results to a variable.
# Print out your result as a string


# *EXERCISE 4 HINT*
# Use the input function to get the users number, and make sure you are getting an integer back.
# Write a function to check if the number given would be divisible by 2 with a remainder of zero. If so, print even; else, print odd.



# *EXERCISE 5 HINT* 
# Create a function to take in one parameter(a list).
# Use the len() function and indices to get the numbers located in the first and last position of your list.



# *EXERCISE 6 HINT*
# Use Python input() function to accept a string from a user.
# Calculate the length of string using the len() function
# Next, iterate each character of a string using for loop and range() function.
# Use start = 0, stop = len(word), and step =2. the step is 2 because we want only even index numbers



# *EXERCISE 7 HINT* 
# Use string slicing to get the substring. For example, to remove the first four characters use x[4:].



# *EXERCISE 8 HINT* 
# Use the index of the list, and write an if/else statement to compare and return either true or false. 



# *EXERCISE 9 HINT* 
# Write a function that determines which numbers can be divided by 5 with a remainder of 0.
# Set up an empty list to placeyour new numbers in.
# Return all numbers that are divisible by 5 evenly. 
# Append those numbers to a new list.



# *EXERCISE 10 HINT*
# Use string method count().



# *EXERCISE 11 HINT*
# Use a for loop and range.



# *EXERCISE 12 HINT*
# Create an empty list
# Iterate first list using a for loop
# In each iteration, check if the current number is odd using num % 2 != 0 formula. If the current number is an odd number, add it to the result list
# Now, Iterate the first list using a loop.
# In each iteration, check if the current number is even using num % 2 == 0 formula. If the current number is an even number, add it to the result list
# print the result list



# *EXERCISE 13 PART 1 HINT *
# Use a while loop



# *EXERCISE 13 PART 2 HINT *
# Use the slice method unique to Python



# *EXERCISE 14 HINT *
# Create the outer for loop to iterate numbers from 1 to 10. So total number of iteration of the outer loop is 10.
# Create a inner loop to iterate 10 times.
# For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop will execute ten times.
# In the first iteration of the nested loop, the number is 1. In the next, it 2. and so on till 10.
# In each iteration of an inner loop, we calculated the multiplication of two numbers. (current outer number and curent inner number)



# *EXERCISE 15 HINT *
# Print the pattern using two for loops and range functions. 



# *EXERCISE 16 HINT *
# Use a while loop in your function. 



# *EXERCISE 17 HINT *
# The file you are trying to read MUST be located in your root directory.
# Use the split function
# Use a for loop
# Set your initial count variable to 0
# Increment the count



# *EXERCISE 18 HINT *
# The file you are trying to read MUST be located in your root directory.
# Use the split function
# Use a for loop and an if statement
# Set your initial count variable to 0
# Increment the count



# *EXERCISE 19 HINT *
# The file you are trying to read MUST be located in your root directory.
# Use the split function
# Use a for loop and an if statement, getting the length of each word < 4



# *EXERCISE 20 HINT *
# The file you are trying to read MUST be located in your root directory.
# Use the split function
# Use a for loop and an if statement
# Use .lower()
# Set your initial count variable to 0
# Increment the count



# *EXERCISE 21 HINT *
# The file you are trying to read MUST be located in your root directory.
# Use the split function
# Use a for loop and an if statement
# Get the last index and see if it == 'e'
# Set your initial count variable to 0
# Increment the count



# *EXERCISE 22 HINT *
# The file you are trying to read MUST be located in your root directory.
# Use a for loop and an if statement
# See if the letter is upper case, using .isupper()
# Set your initial count variable to 0
# Increment the count



# *EXERCISE 23 HINT *
# Set up our function to take in two parameters, both booleans
# Use an if statement so that if our first parameter is false or our second parameter is true, it returns true. Else return false.



# *EXERCISE 24 HINT *
# Set up our function to take in two parameters, both booleans
# Use an if statement so that if neither are smiling it returns true.
# Use another if statement so that if they are both smiling it returns true.
