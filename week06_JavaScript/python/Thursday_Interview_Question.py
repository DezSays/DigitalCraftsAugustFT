# Create a program that generates 30 students. Each student should have an ID and grade(numerical 0-100). ID should be a 9 digit number
# Take those students grades and curve them, the highest grade becoming a 95. Adjust your gradebook to assign a letter grade based on the new values
# Write a unittest to verify that your function is working
